subtitle: The early evolution of vertebrates

I am interested in the early evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), the group to which we (humans) belong. In particular I study them using  methods to visualise fossils three-dimensionally in the rocky matrix.

At the moment my research focuses on the evolution of modern sharks and rays (elasmobranchs). Modern groups of elasmobranch seem to have originated in the Mesozoic, but much remains understood about the timing of this process and the skeletal anatomy of these early sharks. I am trying to combine information from the skeletons of extinct sharks from the Mesozoic with information of the anatomy and genomes of living sharks to try and find answers to some of these questions.

I am also interested in the very earliest period in the evolution of the more inclusive group to which sharks and rays belong (along with chimaeras): the cartilaginous fishes (or chondrichthyans). During my PhD I worked on this early period in chondrichthyan evolution, studying the fossilised remains of acanthodians, members of the chondrichthyan stem-group which flourished during the Devonian. I continued this line of research during my first post-doc, in Paris, working on acanthodians and becoming interested in early relatives of chimaeras from the Carboniferous.

Beyond sharks I also have an interest in the earliest jawed vertebrates which, rather counter-intuitively, lacked jaws. During my postdoc in Birmingham I worked on how these animals fed without jaws, using imaging methods to understand their feeding apparatus. I also picked up an interest in something even older...

A unifying theme in my research into these areas is the use of computed tomographic (CT) methods to image difficult-to-visualise specimens. These methods use x-rays to allow scientists to non-destructively and three-dimensionally visualise the shape of fossils inside the rocky matrix. Usually, I use industrial CT scanners to do this, for example the facility in Life Sciences at the University of Bristol. However, I've also been lucky enough to get time on synchrotron scanners, such as the ESRF in Grenoble. I combine the data from these methods with phylogenetic and functional morphological methods.
