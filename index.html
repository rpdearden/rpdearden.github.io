<p>I am Richard Dearden, a palaeobiologist interested in the the early evolution of vertebrates, in particular cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, and chimaeras). At the moment I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.naturalis.nl/en/richard-dearden">Naturalis Biodiversity Center</a>, the Dutch national natural history museum in Leiden.</p> 

<p>This website has overviews of me and my research, as well as more details on my MSCA, DEADSharks.</p>
