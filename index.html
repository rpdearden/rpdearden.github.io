<p>I am Richard Dearden, a palaeobiologist interested in the the early evolution of vertebrates, in particular cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, and chimaeras). At the moment I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral researcher at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the Dutch national natural history museum in Leiden.</p> 

<p>This website has overviews of me and my research, as well as my Dead Fishes blog (below), in which I'll try and post interesting fossil fish stories once monthly.</p>
