subtitle: A palaeoichthyological postdoc
---
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, which is the Dutch national natural history museum in Leiden. At the moment I am funded by my Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship [DEADSharks: divergence times, evolution, and anatomy deciphered in early Sharks](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101062426).

Previously I have done postdocs at the University of Birmingham, UK and the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Before that I did my PhD at Imperial College London, a Masters at the Univeristy of Bristol, and my undergrad at the University of Cambridge.

I am involved in the [Palaeontological Association](https://www.palass.org/association/council) as the reviews editor and Trustee. I was also on the production team for Duncan Leosteus'award tiumph at the [Palaeovision Song Contest 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k716l0ytDsg). 

As well as fossil fishes I also enjoy reading books (especially popular history and science fiction) painting miniatures (Warhammer 40k mostly), and playing computer games (grand strategy, action-RPG).
