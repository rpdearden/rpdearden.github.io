title: About me
subtitle: The early evolution of vertebrates
---
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the Dutch national natural history museum in Leiden. I am interested in the evolution of vertebrates, especially in the cartilaginous fishes, the group that includes living sharks and rays. 

This website has my CV and a publication list and links to my social media. It also has my blog, Deadfishes, on which I post short write ups of random things I think are interesting in the world of palaeoichthyology.
