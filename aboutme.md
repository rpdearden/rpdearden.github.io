subtitle: A palaeoichthyological postdoc

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, which is the Dutch national natural history museum in Leiden. At the moment I am funded by my Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship [DEADSharks: divergence times, evolution, and anatomy deciphered in early Sharks](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101062426).

Previously I have done postdocs at the University of Birmingham, UK and the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Before that I did my PhD at Imperial College London, a Masters at the Univeristy of Bristol, and my undergrad at the University of Cambridge.

As well as fossil fishes I also enjoy reading books (especially popular history and science fiction) painting miniatures (Warhammer 40k mostly), and playing computer games (grand strategy, action-RPG).
